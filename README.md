### Summary
This recipe app demonstrates production-ready iOS development practices with clean architecture and comprehensive testing. The app displays recipes in an intuitive list interface with navigation to detailed views, 
featuring custom disk-based image caching for optimal performance. Key features include pull-to-refresh functionality, robust error handling for malformed data, and search filtering for enhanced user experience.

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
I prioritized core functionality and performance over visual polish, focusing on smooth user experience fundamentals. The custom image caching implementation was essential for meeting project requirements while 
demonstrating advanced iOS development skills. I emphasized clean MVVM architecture, comprehensive error handling, and modern SwiftUI patterns to create a maintainable codebase that could easily accommodate 
future feature additions.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
Approximately 5-6 hours total. Custom image caching consumed the largest portion (~2.5 hours), followed by core functionality implementation (~2 hours), unit testing (~1 hour), and final polish with search 
functionality (~30 minutes). This allocation prioritized the most technically challenging requirements first while ensuring adequate test coverage.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
I chose to focus on technical excellence over feature breadth, implementing robust core functionality rather than extensive feature sets. While I considered adding recipe sorting, favorites functionality,
and enhanced UI animations, I prioritized meeting all stated requirements with high quality implementation. This approach ensured reliable performance and clean architecture that would serve as a solid 
foundation for future enhancements.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
The error handling could be more sophisticated with specific user-facing messaging for different failure scenarios. Currently, network errors and parsing errors show generic messages, whereas a production app 
would benefit from more granular error states and recovery options. Additionally, the image cache lacks memory management optimization that would be essential for apps handling larger image datasets.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
The project successfully demonstrates modern iOS development practices including Swift concurrency, SwiftUI navigation, and custom caching without third-party dependencies. I implemented comprehensive unit 
testing focused on business logic rather than UI, following industry best practices. Given more time, I would add accessibility support, implement more sophisticated loading states, and mess around with various 
image cache eviction policies.
